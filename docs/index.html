            <p>A cycloid is a mathematical curve traced by a point on the circumference of a circle as it rolls along a straight line. A prolate cycloid, also known as an extended cycloid, is traced by a point at a radius greater than the radius of the rolling circle. A curtate cycloid, also known as a contracted cycloid, is traced by a point at a radius smaller than the radius of the rolling circle. Cycloids have significant applications in various fields, including mathematics, physics, and engineering.</p>
